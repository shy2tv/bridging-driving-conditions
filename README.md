*Our proposed SDG-DA pipeline: clear images → simulation → diffusion → blending → DA-UNIT → realistic adverse images.*

## About

Autonomous Driving (AD) systems struggle in adverse conditions like fog, rain, and nighttime due to under-represented training data.  
This work proposes a **target-data-free domain adaptation pipeline** that transforms clear-weather driving images into realistic foggy, rainy, snowy, and nighttime scenes.  

We combine **simulation (CARLA)**, **diffusion models (Stable Diffusion / ALDM)**, and **GANs (DA-UNIT)** with adaptive blending and auxiliary inputs to generate fully-labelled synthetic datasets.  

Our pipeline improves downstream perception tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection) on the ACDC benchmark — achieving up to **4.6% mIoU improvement in nighttime scenes**, without using real adverse-condition images during training.
