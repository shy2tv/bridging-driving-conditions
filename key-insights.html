            <h3>Auxiliary Inputs Matter</h3>
            <p>Depth and semantic maps significantly improve object preservation during domain adaptation. Different configurations have distinctive effects on the generated images.</p>

            <h3>Cross-Weather Transfer</h3>
            <p>Training on certain weather conditions provides unexpected benefits for others, suggesting shared underlying features across different adverse conditions.</p>

            <h3>Size Distribution Challenges</h3>
            <p>Clear weather scenes often contain smaller, more difficult objects - a counterintuitive finding that explains certain performance patterns.</p>
